# Statement of Work (SOW)

## Project Title:
Multiplayer Battleship Game Using Sockets in Python

## Team:
Casey Stump

## Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a multiplayer version of the classic Battleship game using socket programming in Python. 
The game will allow multiple players to connect over a network, place their ships, and take turns to guess the locations of the opponent's ships. 
The objective is to create a fully functional, interactive, and user-friendly game that demonstrates the principles of socket programming and network communication.

## Scope:

### Inclusions:
- Development of a server-client architecture using Python sockets.
- Implementation of game logic for placing ships, taking turns, and checking for hits and misses.
- Creation of a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game.
- Testing and debugging of the game to ensure smooth gameplay.
- Documentation of the code and user manual.

### Exclusions:
- Development of AI opponents.
- Cross-platform compatibility beyond the specified operating systems.
- Advanced graphical enhancements beyond the basic GUI.

## Deliverables:
- A working Python script for the server and client.
- A GUI for the game.
- Documentation including code comments, a user manual, and a project report.
- A presentation demonstrating the game and its features.
