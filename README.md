# Battleship-Game
This is a simple Battleship game implemented using Python and sockets.

**How to play:**
1. **Start the server:** Run the `pyhton Server.py` script.
2. **Connect clients:** Run the `pyhton Client.py --host <IP address of host> --port 5444` script on two different machines or terminals.
3. Clients can send messages to the server.
4. Game state is syncronized across clients and shown.
Game tells each playr whos turn it is and keeps track of it.
Moves are inabled, but game board is not implemented yet, so nothing happens.
